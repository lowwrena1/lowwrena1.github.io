        <h3>Gif Tastic!!</h3>
        <p> Gif tastic is my first attempt at an app using api keys and ajax pull request. The user types in the title of a 90's cartoon and the ajax pulls 10 still images of the cartoon the user selected. When the images are clicked on they turn into gifs until clicked on again turning them back to a still image.</p>
